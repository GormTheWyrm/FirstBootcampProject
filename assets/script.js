// first we need to get the user's location using their data
//then we need to get the time for that location and display it (using an API? or JS might 
//have that feature built in, idk)
//then we need to pull up an image based on the location 
//then we need to list times in major cities around the world
//we also need to render an interactive globe that shows you where you are on the globe (Google API?)
