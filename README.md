This app shows the users location



Have we finalized the APIs?
how do we want user input?
    buttons are easiest
    what does user need to type?



1. Alert that asks user if they want to use browser location
2. pulls info for that location
3. loads pins for preset locations
4. user can search for a location
    -long,lat
    -city name

Things Geordin thinks should be implemented
    1. zoom out a bit upon pulling up a city. The globe spins so the city leaves the page too soon
        alternative is to reduce or stop globe spin, but I like that the globe spins, it just looks better when zoomed out
    2. ???
    3. Profit!
    4. we will talk about the presentation we need to give on thursday. Take care of yourselves.
