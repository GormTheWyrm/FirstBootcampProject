directions for future development
links to deployed app and github repo



cities displayed;
 
    london
    LA
    beijing
    moscow
    sidney
    

Things Geordin thinks should be implemented
    1. zoom out a bit upon pulling up a city. The globe spins so the city leaves the page too soon
        alternative is to reduce or stop globe spin, but I like that the globe spins, it just looks better when zoomed out
    2. ???
    3. Profit!
    4. we will talk about the presentation we need to give on thursday. Take care of yourselves.
