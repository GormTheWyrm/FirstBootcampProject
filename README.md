# FirstBootcampProject

We built a simple webpage that connects to 




elevator pitch; 1 minute description
concept; write a user story and motivation for development
process- tech used. how were roles assigned and broken down?
    list challenges and successes
demo the app
directions for future development
links to deployed app and github repo



cities displayed;
 
    london
    LA
    beijing
    moscow
    sidney
    

Things Geordin thinks should be implemented
    1. zoom out a bit upon pulling up a city. The globe spins so the city leaves the page too soon
        alternative is to reduce or stop globe spin, but I like that the globe spins, it just looks better when zoomed out
    2. ???
    3. Profit!
    4. we will talk about the presentation we need to give on thursday. Take care of yourselves.

        BIGGEST PART IS Demo-ing the project.

        dmitri suggest
        if we had more time what would we do/have done?
            fun facts for different countries.
                might have brought in another API, but we have not identifies which one yet...
