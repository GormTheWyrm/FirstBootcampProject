# World City Viewer
https://gormthewyrm.github.io/FirstBootcampProject/  

As members of a global community, we often deal with people who live in different time zones. 
This app was created to help users connect with others around the globe.
We used 3 APIs;
  WebGL Earth JavaScript API
  TimeZone DB API
  Opencage Geocoding API

We used WebGl Earth to add markers to a globe, extracting longitude and latitude coordinates of the searched locations.
We then used Opencage API to acquire the timezones for those coordinates.
Finally we used the TimeZone API to pull up more detailed time information.

# Use/Instructions

This app creates 5 pins on major cities upon startup. The City Name, Country and time are displayed.

    london
    Los Angeles
    Beijing
    Moscow 
    Sidney
    
The user can search for and add markers to additional locations, pulling up information on time, date, country, time zone and coordinates.
