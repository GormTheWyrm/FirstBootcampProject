This app shows the users location



Have we finalized the APIs?
how do we want user input?
    buttons are easiest
    what does user need to type?



1. Alert that asks user if they want to use browser location
2. pulls info for that location
3. loads pins for preset locations
4. user can search for a location
    -long,lat
    -city name
